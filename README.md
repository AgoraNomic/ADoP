Hiya! This is a template for officers wanting to configure a microsite within <https://agoranomic.org>.

There are two branches in this template:

- `main` holds whatever you'd like. Most often, this would contain any scripts or automations you use to facilitate the officer duties.
- `gh-pages` holds your GitHub Pages deployment (which is used to generate content for the site.) Head on over to that branch for some more information and basic setup instructions.

Feel free to replace the content of this `README` with anything you think a future officer might want to know about your automations!

If you ever have any questions or are in need of any support, feel free to contact your Webmastor! Best of luck with your Agora-ing!
